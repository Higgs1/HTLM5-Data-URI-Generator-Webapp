HTLM5 Data URI Generator Webapp
===============================

A simple HTML5 webapp demonstration that allows you to create a data uri either from a file or by entering in text.

Features
--------
More or less a list of things I was experimenting with.
* Twitter Bootstrap
  * Responsive design (looks great with both a wide display and a narrow display)
  * Tabs
  * Autocomplete
* HTML5
  * File reader API
  * Drag and Drop
  * Application Cache
  * Web Apps
* jQuery
* Selecting an element with JavaScript
* Converting data to a data URI

Planned Features
----------------
Things I'd like to implement in the future.
* Localization (properly)
  * Also, if anybody wants to translate this app I'd be delighted, thanks. (I am, sadly, monolingual)
* Select tab using URL hash
* Font awesome
* Test for iPhone support (could somebody with an iPhone help me with this?)
